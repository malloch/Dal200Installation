            Beatrice completed her undergraduate studies in mathematics and physics at the University of Toronto’s Trinity College in 1944 and soon afterward enlisted in the Women’s Royal Canadian Naval Service. She served as a harbor defense researcher at the Naval Research Establishment at Her Majesty’s Canadian Ship Establishment Stadacona, in Halifax, NS.

        <h2 class="catch-ttl">CAREER IN COMPUTING</h2>
        <p class="desc">
            She studied her master in mathematics at MIT. There, she received exposure to new computer technology through her coursework and research. With a shortage of jobs in computing in Canada, she was later able to negotiate a position as a project assistant at the University of Toronto’s newly established Computation Centre for a purported salary of $200 per month.

        <h2 class="catch-ttl">DIFFERENTIAL ANALYZER</h2>
        <p class="desc">
            She built a differential analyzer: an early mechanical analog computer that could solve equations using Meccano parts. She also worked on IBM's punch calculator together with fellow project supervisors.

        <h2 class="catch-ttl">DOCTORATE IN COMPUTER SCIENCE</h2>
        <p class="desc">
            She visited the Mathematical Laboratory at the University of Cambridge to learn about an early computer called the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC). She is considered as the first female to complete a Ph.D. in computer science, in 1952.
