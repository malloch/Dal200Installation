            In 1976 after graduating high school, Joyce designed a simple quiz game as a contract employee at The RCA Studio where her father worked.
            However, her work was never released on RCA's console and was eclipsed by Atari's VCS and Magnavox's Odyssey, making it a massive failure for RCA's home entertainment division.
